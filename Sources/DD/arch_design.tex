\subsection{Component Interfaces}
In this section all the interfaces that connect each component in the component view are explained and analyzed.
\subsubsection{Passenger UI Logic Interface}
This interface provides the entry point to the system for the passenger.
The following is a list of the methods provided by this interface, they are all pretty self-explanatory:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{showHome()}
	\item \texttt{showLogin()}
	\item \texttt{showSignUp()}
	\item \texttt{showRequestPage()}
	\item \texttt{showReservationPage()}
	\item \texttt{showRequestInformation()}
	\item \texttt{submitLoginCredentials()}
	\item \texttt{submitRegistrationCred()}
	\item \texttt{submitRequestData()}
	\item \texttt{submitReservationData()}
\end{itemize}
The interface is comprised as a series of methods that the passenger can invoke. Each \texttt{show*()} method maps to a specific web page or screen in the mobile application, the actual invocation takes place when a passenger loads in his/her browser or in the application one of the screens. Each page or screen has some sort of navigation methods so that it can call some of the other \texttt{show*()} methods present in this interface.
The \texttt{submit*()} methods are called when the passenger wants to send data to system for instance when he/she has just completed the filling of a form, they validate the input and forward the request of the appropriate component in the system back-end, eventually they show a informative page or screen that notifies the user whether the operation completed or not, and in the latter case why. 
\subsubsection{Taxi Driver UI Logic Interface}
This interface provides the entry point to the system for the taxi driver.
...
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{showLogin()}
	\item \texttt{submitLoginCredentials()}
	\item \texttt{acceptRequest()}
	\item \texttt{rejectRequest()}
	\item \texttt{changeWorkingStatus()}
	\item \texttt{showNewIncomingRequest()} (explain)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{System Administrator UI Logic Interface}
This interface provides the entry point to the system for the administrator.
...
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{showLogin()}
	\item \texttt{showMainMenu()}
	\item \texttt{showAddNewDriver()}
	\item \texttt{showRemoveDriver()}
	\item \texttt{showModifyDriver()}
	\item \texttt{submitLoginCredentials()}
	\item \texttt{submitDriverInformations()}
	\item \texttt{submitDeleteRequest()}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Access control interface}
\subsubsection{Ride manager interface}
\subsubsection{Queue manager interface}
\subsubsection{myTaxiService Database interface}
\subsubsection{Maps Service interface}
