\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This document represents the Design Document (DD). It describes completely the system in terms of components, analyzing their internal and external interaction (with the actors). It starts from the description of the system given in the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document. In this document the system is treated as a white box, i.e. the document ``opens" it and then dissects it starting from an high level overview to a more detailed representation. This document is addressed to all developers and programmers who have to implement the actual software.

\subsection{Document Structure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Section 1: Introduction, it gives a description of this document, some basic information in order to clearly understand the subsequent sections.
	\item Section 2: Architectural Design, it describes the software to be designed starting from an high level representation and then dissecting it providing a more in detail analysis. Diagrams are provided to better clarify this part.
	\item Section 3: Algorithm Design: it gives a description of the main algorithms that are implemented in the software, pseudo-code or flow diagrams are provided to describe them more clearly.
	\item Section 4: User Interface Design: starting from the mockups presented in the RASD, this part further explain the interaction between the actors and the system, and shows how it will look like.
	\item Section 5: Requirements Traceability, this part explain how the requirements defined in the RASD map into the design elements that we have defined in this document. All the requirements are covered.
	\item Section 6: References: provides a list of external documents and material that helped the writing of this document.
