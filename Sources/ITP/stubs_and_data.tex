\subsection{Program Stubs}
The following table summarizes stubs used throughout the ITP.
\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3\linewidth}|p{0.25\linewidth}|p{0.45\linewidth}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Stub} & \textbf{Test(s) Involved} & \textbf{Description} \\
	\hline 
	Passenger UI Logic & I1T1 & Upon methods calling, it returns sample views and instructions to perform requested operations. It also provides fake notifications to Passenger that are supposed to be generated by back-end components.\\
	\hline
	Taxi Driver UI Logic & I1T2 & It shows sample views and notifications to Taxi Driver. \\
	\hline
	Sys Admin UI Logic & I1T3 & It shows sample views and messages to System Administrator. \\
	\hline
	Access Control & I2T1, I3T1, I4T1 & It returns sample responses upon sign in, sign up of both Passenger and Taxi Driver, also login for System Administrator. \\
	\hline
	Ride Manager & I2T2 & It returns sample notifications to the front-end about new rides freshly assigned or correctly reserved. Notifications for exceptional conditions (such as multiple declines of a same request) are also provided.\\
	\hline
	Queue Manager & I3T2, I6T1 & It provides fake free taxis to be assigned to an incoming ride and also sample notifications of requests supposed to be declined by a Taxi Driver. \\
	\hline
	myTaxiService Database & I5T1 & It returns sample data supposed to be stored in the database, for instance Passengers already registered and Taxi Drivers. \\
	\hline
	Cars and Drivers Database & I5T2 & It returns sample data supposed to be stored in the database, for instance valid Taxi Drivers licenses. \\

\subsection{Test Data Required}
In order to test correctly some features it is mandatory to have data that should be managed by the system during Integration Testing. \\
Data must be already present in our internal database, i.e. some passengers and drivers already registered and a system administrator as well in order to test login features and access right management.
