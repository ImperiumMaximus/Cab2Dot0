\subsection{Test Data Required}
In order to test correctly some features it is mandatory to have some data that should be managed by the system during Integration Testing. \\
Some data must be already present in our internal database, i.e. some passengers and drivers already registered and a system administrator as well in order to test login features and access rights management.
