\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of an Integration Test Plan (ITP) is to describe the necessary tests to verify that all the components of a software are properly assembled and work together as expected. This document explain thoroughly the tests to be performed, the main criteria that led us to chose them, in which order they must be executed and their expected result.
\subsection{Scope}
The aim of the project is to create a new brand system that optimizes an 
existing taxi service.
The system will be capable of automatizing and/or simplifying certain 
processes during requests or reservations of taxis.
It will also guarantee a fair management of taxi queues.
New passengers can sign up for service inserting some basic information in order to use service's features as soon as possible.
A passenger can request a taxi using web service or through mobile
application after registration. The system will be able to localize precisely the position
of the passenger, determining taxis that are available near
him/her. The system will select a taxi and then it will forward the request to one of its driver.
Upon confirmation, the system will notify the customer about the successful completion of the operation and the ETA of the taxi. A passenger can also reserve a taxi by specifying time and date, but they have to do it with at least two hours in advance. Cancellation is also permitted. The system will actually process the request ten minutes before the time specified during the reservation in the same way as described previously.
