The diagram above shows work division between two teammates and it is a direct consequence of previous Gantt diagram. \\
Most of the work has been done at the same time by the two. This because, like it is shown in Gantt diagram, initial meeting, deployment phase and document writings are impossible to divide into sub tasks, in fact first two have to be done by both teammates due to their relevant importance, whereas for the last one it is unworkable to give assignements from the start.\\
Because of the complexity of development, inclusive of testing, inspection parts and previous reasons exposed in precedent paragraph, code writing and inspections are the tasks fragmented and assigned to the two teammates. A letter and a number are allocated to every sub task: a \texttt{D} is given to software development assignments, whereas a \texttt{I} to inspection tasks.\\
Some sub assignments are carried out simultaneously due to their complexity and need to be perfectly completed, others can be done separately by two teammates. \\
Now two lists follow, explaining the meaning of every letter - number couple.
\paragraph{Deployment Phase and Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item D1: myTaxiService Database Creation and testing
\item D2: Car and Driver Database implementation and testing 
\item D3: Access Control Implementation and testing
\item D4: Implementation of Map Service and testing
\item D5: Queue Manager Implementation and testing
\item D6: Ride Manager Implementation and testing
\item D7: UI Logic Implementation and testing
\item D8: GUI implementation and testing
\end{itemize}  
\paragraph{Inspection Phase}
\begin{itemize}
\item I1: GUI Inspection
\item I2: UI Logic Inspection 
\item I3: Access Control Inspection
\item I4: Ride Manager Inspection
\item I5: Queue Manager Inspection
\item I6: Cars and Drivers Database Inspection
\item I7: myTaxiService Database Inspection
\item I8: Maps Service Inspection
\end{itemize}
