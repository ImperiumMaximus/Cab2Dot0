\section{Classes assigned}
The following list includes a set of classes contained in a source code assigned to us and packages in which they reside in.
Actually in our assignment, there is only one class to inspect and it is declared in this way:
\sourcesnippet{85-85}{\texttt{DeploymentDescriptorNode} declaration.}{Code/DeploymentDescriptorNode.java}
This class resides in a package declared at the beginning of the source Java file:
\sourcesnippet{41-41}{\texttt{DeploymentDescriptorNode} package membership declaration.}{Code/DeploymentDescriptorNode.java}
That package is inside a module called \texttt{Deployment Object Library}. \newline
Its pathname is\newline \texttt{appserver/deployment/dol/src/main/java/com/sun/enterprise/deployment/node}, and the filename of the source code is \texttt{DeploymentDescriptorNode.java}.
Below there is a diagram which describes a hierarchy for this class:
