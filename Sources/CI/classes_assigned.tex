\section{Classes assigned}
The following list includes a set of classes of the software's source code assigned to us and the packages in which they reside in.
Actually in our assignment, there's only one class to inspect and it is declared as follows:
\sourcesnippet{85-85}{\texttt{DeploymentDescriptorNode} declaration.}{Code/DeploymentDescriptorNode.java}
This class resides in the package declared at the beginning of the source Java file:
\sourcesnippet{41-41}{\texttt{DeploymentDescriptorNode} package membership declaration.}{Code/DeploymentDescriptorNode.java}
The package itself is inside the module called \texttt{Deployment Object Library}. \newline
The pathname of the file which this class resides in is\newline \texttt{appserver/deployment/dol/src/main/java/com/sun/enterprise/deployment/node}, and the filename for the source code is \texttt{DeploymentDescriptorNode.java}.
Below there's the diagram which describes the classes hierarchy for this class:
